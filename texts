I wanted to give you a quick update on the script I've been working on. The     
script is designed to merge multiple job execution reports into a single        
consolidated report called mergeFinal. It processes the individual reports,     
aggregates the data, and outputs a comprehensive summary that includes details  
such as the number of inquiries added, inquiries not added, and physical PIN    
merges. This should make it easier to review and analyze the overall job        
execution performance.
