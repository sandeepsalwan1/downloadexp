Hi Sandeep, if Yogi didn't give you other project to do, you can take this one for now:
  
java util program.
A decode/encode util program that decodes the MF Binary formatted file into clear text file and encodes the clear text file into the MF Binary formatted file.
 
Currently we have, kind of decode program, ConverterFormatB.jar, in the git repo:
https://code.experian.local/projects/BAAP/repos/service-inquiry-logging/browse/src/main/java/com/experian/sil/core/ConverterFormatB.java
You can take a look at it and work on a new java class that does both encoding and decoding operations.
Thanks.
